# Data-Visualization
Two R markdown work about COVID-19 is enclosed in the repository.

- "COVID-19 Mortality in Europe" is a school project about data visualisation. My topic is to study the reasons behind the large variance observed in COVID-19 mortality rates within Europe. It visualised the relationship between mortality rates and other factors, such as urbanisation rate, the prevalence of COVID-19 testing and the capacity of public hospital systems.
- "HK COVID-19 data" is a tracker I made for myself to observe the transmission landscape in Hong Kong. It obtains data from the Centre for Health Protection directly and calculate the effective reproductive number as a time series.
